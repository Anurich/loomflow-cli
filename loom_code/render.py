"""Render loomflow ``Event``s to the terminal with ``rich``.

``Agent.stream()`` yields ``Event`` objects — ``model_chunk``,
``tool_call``, ``tool_result``, ``permission_ask``, ``completed``,
``error``, etc. This module turns that event stream into the
live terminal UI. It is PURELY presentation — no agent logic.

Event payloads are plain dicts; we ``.get()`` everything
defensively so a payload-shape change in loomflow degrades to a
slightly-uglier line instead of a crash.
